##### Functional Programming
this project taught me many of the core concepts of functional programming; requiring me to think in a different way than I was perhaps used to.

##### AI techniques
This project taught me some core AI algorithms, particularly those suited for 1v1 open board games. For example the aforementioned alpha beta pruning algorithm.

##### Team development
Further strengthened my ability to work in a team, in this case during a particularly challenging time during the start of the COVID pandemic. It required us to have strong communication skills and be capable in technologies such as version control and Github.
