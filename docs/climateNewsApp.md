##### External APIs
We used an external API to gather the news articles to display our application. This taught me how to utilise documentation to get the most out of an external API.

##### Time Management/Very Short Deadline
As aforementioned, this project was created as part of a 24 hour hackathon. This tested both me and my teams time management skills as well as our ability to learn and retain a lot of new information in a short time. By the end of the 24 hour we had a fully working application.

##### Team management
Coming into this project I was the only member of a team of 5 who had experience developing in NodeJS and React. Therefore one of the key parts of this project was being able to offload and communicate by knowledge effectively to the other members of the team such that they could incrementally develop their own parts of the project.
