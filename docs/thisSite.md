##### Deployment
Taught me further how to develop and deploy a site.

##### Responsive Site
One thing many of my sites had failed in was being responsive in their CSS design. This site was therefore a great chance to practice creating a design which's interface adapts to the device it is displayed on.

##### CSS and CSS transitions
As aforementioned I wanted to develop my CSS skills during this project. Therefore this site is done with nearly entirely custom compoenents, including custom transitions and CSS animations.
