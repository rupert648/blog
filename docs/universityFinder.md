##### NoSQL Databases
This project was my first introduction to building a database in a NoSQL database system, in this case MongoDB.

##### React
One of the first projects I developed in React, this project was important to understanding the core react concepts and how to build a asynchronously requesting React application.

##### Individual Project
I built this project independent of any classes in my free time. This was a key project in beginning to develop my ability to learn individually efficiently, and to use self-taught skills to develop a successful project.
