##### Database Design
Designing a database to store all the required management whilst simultaneously ensuring the finished database design was in Boyce Codd Normal form; ensuring atomicity, consistency as well as avoiding data redundancy.

##### Advanced Database Creation/Management
This database was created/hosted in MariaDB. In order to improve usability of the database, as well as practice my MySQL skills I tried to utilise as much of the MariaDB functionality as possible. Including but not limited to; functions, triggers, views and procedures.

##### Complex Query Design
Again this project was the perfect chance to practice my query building skills. Querys I built often utilised many relations and performed complex operations such as sub-queries, aggregate functions, views and multiple table joins.
