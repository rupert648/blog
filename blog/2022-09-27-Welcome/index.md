Welcome to my blog!
---
Here I will hopefully be posting just about anything tech or software engineering related. Tutorials, Software Deep Dives, topics I find interesting - anything I feel like writing about I will be dumping here.
<hr/>

The aim of this is to help me really focus in on my understanding of interesting topics - I've found creating a piece of writing on a particular topic really enables me to fully comprehend the topic at hand. It often requires me to research beyong the scope of my own use case for a particular library, technology or whatever it may be. This in turn can allow me to better leverage that technology, as well as understand its other use cases. This summation of knowledge can then help me make better decisions in the future about tech stacks, and thus hopefully a better software developer!

That said, I doubt all posts here will be that structured or detailed, and I also hope it for it to be somewhere for me to dump random ideas or thoughts.

Depending on the content, this will mostly be a clone of my Medium account - which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@rupertcarr).
